excerpt: 'The main type of communication system can be divided into base-band transmission and pass-band transmission. For baseband transmission, polar NRZ coding is utilized among common PCM coding schemes to achieve the best error
performance when the SNR stays the same. Matched filter receiver is adopted to carry on error analysis. For pass-band
transmission, signal-space is introduced to simplify the procedure with a few examples. Then a new Euclidean space is
mentioned, which is sort of different from the former, to directly map sending bits with their actual position on the space.
2D and 3D space, related to the 4-ary system and 8-ary system respectively, is depicted to illustrate the point. At last, a
potential application for pixel maps is considered to qualitatively underscore the error impact on the practical system.'
