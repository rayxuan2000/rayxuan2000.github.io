Research Experience
=====
Particle Swarm Optimization for High-dimension UAV Route Planning	03/2022-06/2022
Supervisor: Feng Yan, Associate Professor of SEU’s National Mobile Communication Research Lab
 * Used the standard formula in evolutionary algorithm based offline/online path planner for UAV navigation to describe the terrain as a matrix for scene terrain modeling
 * Described the principle of the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, with the cost function using total distance as an evaluation metric while limiting the UAV position range, drew a flow chart in VISIO, along with a pseudo-code description
 * Simulated and verified the revised algorithm’s effect in MATLAB, obtained optimal results and convergence curves under three scenarios, compared the algorithms’ mean and standard deviation before and after the modification
 * Analyzed possible challenges such as learning factor selection and algorithm convergence, and completed an IEEE conference-compliant paper
