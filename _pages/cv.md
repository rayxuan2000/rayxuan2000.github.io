Summary
======
A first-year graduate student who aims to find data scientist internship, with more than one year experience in handling
data sets using machine learning / deep learning, big data framework and data visualization tools to make data-driven
decisions. Solid programming skills in Python and SQL and strong written communication and presentation skills.

Education
======
* University of California, San Diego    CA, US                                                     2023.10-2025.5 (expected)
  * Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering                                                                  GPA: 3.6/4
  * Core coursework: Programming for Data Analysis, Probability and Statistics for Data Science, Scientific Data Analysis and
Statistical Learning, Introduction to Visual Learning, Web Mining and Recommender Systems
* Southeast University    Jiangsu, China                                                                        2019.9-2023.6
  * Bachelor in Information Engineering (with honored degree)                                                     GPA: 3.75/4

Project experience
======
* RNN Based Prediction of Time Series in Stock Market
  * Performed a time series prediction using a LSTM (Long Short - Term Memory) model via PyTorch.
  * Implemented data normalization, divided dataset into two consecutive chunk (first full $$\frac{4}{5}$$ and last $$\frac{1}{5}$$) as training, testing set and loaded data into GPU memory.
  * Built a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) with one LSTM module and a fully connected module, adopted
MMSE metric, imported Adam optimizer and set sliding window size to be 7 for predicting.
  * Trained RNN model with 300 epoch, presented parameters and loss figure with final loss 1.1 × 10^{−3}.

* MovieLens Data Analytics and Recommendation System Simulation
  * Built collaborative filtering algorithms based on Spark machine learning pipeline and deployed recommender system
in production scenario.
  * Implemented online analysis processing (OLAP) for movie data analysis.
  * Used Spark ML to predict ratings, leveraging Alternating Least Square (ALS) algorithm (matrix factorizarion
based ) for a large-scale dataset with resulting RMSE = 0.65.
  * Utilized above trained model and number k (top k liked) to recommend movies with random user id.
